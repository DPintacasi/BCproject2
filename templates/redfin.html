          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Median Sale Price and Inventory, Median Days on Market and Number of Listing with Price Drops</h2>
          <p>I started this project with a hypothesis that there is a direct correlation between higher median sale prices and lower inventories, and I picked the state of New York to evaluate this hypothesis. For this project, I looked at the median price of houses in New York and what I inferred was that some of the counties traditionally have high median sale prices, and inventory is limited. These counties cannot be evaluated for this correlation between the median sale price and inventory. Looking at counties that are not traditionally high priced, I infer that median sale price increases with lower inventories.</p>

          <p>The second hypothesis that I made was that there was a direct correlation between lower levels of inventory and the number of price drops for the houses. Based on the data of New York, you can see that when the number of houses or inventory was low, few people made price drops or reduced the house prices to sell. As inventories increased, more and more people brought down the prices off their homes to sell.</p>

          <p>The third hypothesis that I made was that there was an impact on the median sale price based on the number of days a particular house was on the market. What is inferred from the data is that there are many lower-priced homes in the state of New York. These houses are in the 100K to 250K range and usually do not stay very long on the market. </p>
          
          <p>The final hypothesis that I made what's that ask the number of days a house was on the market increased. There was a chance that the homeowner would reduce the price of the home to sell it. By looking at the data at the whole state of New York, I tried to infer this hypothesis, but the data points are spread out; thus, there's no trend to this data and no correlation.</p>
